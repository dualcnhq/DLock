# DLock

The app is inspired from the BBC TV series Sherlock Season 2 Episode 1 (The Scandal in Belgravia) where Irene Adler was confronted by Sherlock because of the photographs and other valuable information inside her mobile phone that made her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password.

DLock enables you an easy to use lock screen with one-click buttons to send message and make a phone call to the primary contact/person you picked from your contacts. It also has a list of government city directory for police stations, fire stations and hospitals in specific city and DLock can help you contact them and navigate your way to the hospital in the city you picked.

DLock has a reporting feature that allows you to post messages in a hyperlocal bulletin board that connects users within a few kilometres of each other. Itâ€™s a great way to share information and connect with other people without having to know them.
